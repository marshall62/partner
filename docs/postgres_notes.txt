Make sure the configuration being used has the correct db URI
 SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql:///partner'

 I must have only setup postgres on my laptop because the db here is empty.

 Uninstalled version 9.5 and installed newest postgres on 6/26/20  but it still looks to be 9.5 even though I'm told version 12 is available

 Instructions used: https://gorails.com/guides/upgrading-postgresql-version-on-ubuntu-server

 The extra part of installation is:

sudo su - postgres
psql
postgres-# CREATE ROLE your_username WITH LOGIN CREATEDB ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';

su - your_username
createdb partner

cd into partner
psql -d partner < partner_20200303.bak

Now I need to build an instructor login:

Hit the URL as a POST request from postman

localhost:5000/rest/instructor?email=marshall62@gmail.com&password=MyPassword

OR
Use Intellij Tools | Python Console
>>> import partner.create_user
>>> partner.create_user.create_users()


Note:  As part of this 6/26/20 upgrade to postgres I did not run a flask db migrate or upgrade.   That may need to be done

Now start the UI and login
(cd ../ui)
npm start&
localhost:3000
