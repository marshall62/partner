The project has worked with SQLite and Postgres.
I began hooking it up to MySQL probably because of an AWS tutorial.

config.py has different Config classes for different environments and will use different dbs based on the setting of
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI

For pytest testing, it uses an empty SQLite db.

For production it should probably use the AWS path to Mysql and
for dev it should use either a local MySQL or a local postgres (SQLite ok for local but I've discovered that
things don't convert perfectly from SQLite to postgres when moving to Heroku)

See postgres_notes.txt which creates a new postgres db and imports SQLite data into it
and requires that I build an instructor login (a row in the instructor table).
