Add a phonetic field for first name pronunciation.  Should be able to add in the roster page and save with save attendance button.

Save CSV spreadsheet should produce a page of CSV that can be copy/pasted.

Pairs to avoid might be page that I can edit and save.

Provide login/users and put on server elsewhere.

Use real db.

Would be cool if I could get link to student face image to provide this in roster.
