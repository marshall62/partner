Add a phonetic field for first name pronunciation.  Should be able to add in the roster page and save with save attendance button.

May need editable field for adding a nickname if one from banner is wrong

Roster needs a start date for first day of class so that other dates are offset from it.   Need to update RosterToDb to figure this out or take
from config file.

Make student image enlarge on hover.  Make sure this works if I'm not logged into Banner.

- make URL be in config.  Could harvest all the images when I download the roster from banner so that I serve myself.

Save CSV spreadsheet should produce a page of CSV that can be copy/pasted.

Want a simple one-click process for getting latest roster from Banner and into db.

Pairs to avoid might be page that I can edit and save.

Provide login/users and put on server elsewhere.

Use real db.
