GUI:

Features:
Add a phonetic field for first name pronunciation.  Or perhaps a different nickname than the one
that comes from spreadsheet in banner.
Should be able to add in the roster page and save with save attendance button.

- make URL be in config.  Could harvest all the images when I download the roster from banner so that I serve myself.

Decide if I keep pairs2avoid or if the all-possible-groups is sufficient to eliminate pairs2avoid

Provide login/users and put on server elsewhere.

Smith server contact person:  Suzanne Palmer (recommended by Dominique)

Bugs:

Tabs in admin page don't draw correctly probably because of background color

Datepicker requires click on background to select the date.

If student image is missing, don't put in the img tag.   Need to check URL using head and if 404 don't include.



Use real db.
