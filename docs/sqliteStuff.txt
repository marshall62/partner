Install sqlite:
 sudo apt install sqlite3

To create the partner.db from Python classes (first time when sqlite is newly installed):
rm -rd migrations  # first time install
Make sure that the env var DATABASE_URL is not set!

Make sure that app_settings.DevelopmentConfig has commented out postgres line so that it will use sqlite3
# SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql:///partner'
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or \
                              'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'partner.db')

flask db init # generates a db migration
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
# partner.db is now created from the models.py
# If there is not an instructor user/pw create it (see info.txt on how)

# Test the db to see that it has the instructor:

enter python within venv
from partner.models import Instructor
for i in Instructor.query.all():
    print(i.email, i.password)


# Other Db operations:

from partner.models import Student
s = Student(first_name='dave', last_name='M')
partner.db.session.add(s)
partner.db.session.commit() (may need to rollback() first)
Student.query.all()

SQLite CLI operations

$sqlite3 partner.db
> select * from student
>.tables # lists tables
>.schema section #shows section table definition


Changes to models.py means database definitions likely change which means
running migrate like:

flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

This generates files in the migrations dir which then must be pushed to github
so that other installations can get these definitions along with a db backup so
that they can get their db in synch with it.


Backup/Restore

sqlite3 partner.db .backup > partner.backup

restore:
rm existing partner.db
sqlite3 partner.db < partner.backup


Set up SQLite3 db for first time with the Flask app
---------------------------------------------------

These instructions won't work if the db already exists or if I'm starting
from a backup.

make sure that config.cfg has correct path to db. e.g.
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='sqlite:////srv/raiddisk/dev/pairup/partner/partner.db'

N.B.: db needs to live in same dir as the __init__.py that is where the flask app is taken
from

source venv/bin/activate

rm migrations dir

in project root dir (pairup/partner)
flask db init

cd into partner/partner dir (where __init__.py is)
flask db migrate
flas db upgrade

Set up SQLite3 with existing db from backup
-------------------------------------------

restore the backup db into partner.db (see above)
cd partner
open venv
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
