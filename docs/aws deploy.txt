Followed tutorial here: https://medium.com/@rodkey/deploying-a-flask-application-on-aws-a72daba6bb80

1.  Created RDS database instance following the tutorial above

Created an RDS database on AWS according to the instructions above.  Some things were a little different in the UI
notably it did not create a database within MySQL.

After setting up the db in AWS dashboard I got into my local machines pip env and run mysql with the AWS db connection string
obtained from the dashboard:

mysql -h flask-aws-tutorial-db.cmnye3vldx70.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p

I then do:
create database pairup;

user: admin
pw: jupiter62

I then set the config.py
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://admin:jupiter62@flask-aws-tutorial-db.cmnye3vldx70.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com/pairup'


now I need to migrate my database definitions to RDS with

flask db stamp_head  // avoids an error about the database not being updated
flask db migrate
flask db update
