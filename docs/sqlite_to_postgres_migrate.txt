Migrating SQLite to Postgres locally
-------------------------------------

Install postgres
Initially only the postgres user can access the db so must do following:

start a terminal
sudo -i -u postgres
createuser --interactive

give it the username you are logged in with
and make it a superuser

By default when this user logs into the postgres it will try to find
a db by the same name as the user.

Create a db from postgres account:
createdb partner

can now connect to different db:

psql -d partner

To migrate from sqlite backup file:
psql -d partner < partner_20200303.bak

NOte:  I had to hand edit above file to remove pragma
change size of varchar fields to be large enough for strings in data.
change booleans to true/false instead of 1/0
change datetime to timestamp
change all id INT fields to SERIAL
change blob to bytea but data itself won't load because its a bit not a byte.
before each values put the list of columns (not include id)
delete the id value from each of the values lists (postgres wants it to be implicit)
